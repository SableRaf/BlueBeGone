# BlueBeGone
Drastic times call for drastic measures. BlueBeGone Chrome extension removes the very useful "Twitter Blue" and "Verified Organizations" sidebar links.

This project is a natural evolution of [DogeBeGone](https://github.com/SableRaf/dogeBeGone_extension), originally by [RaphaÃ«l](https://twitter.com/sableRaph). The main idea is the same, make twitter just a bit less annoying. I've also added a simple toggle button in the extension pop-up to simplify the process of enabling/disabling it.
